- The chosen data structure for the problem is a non-negative Weighted Directed Graph (WDG).
- An adjacency lists is used to represent the structure.
- The shortest path is computed with Dijkstra's algorithm and a binary heap.

**NOTE**: I understand `route` as an ordered collection of navigation points in a graph.
